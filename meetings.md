    * This was the introductory meeting in which Jake elaborated on the logistics of the project. We discussed the data set that I’ll be using to perform extraction methods on and he agreed to send me several sources relating to different topics in the biomedical field to choose from. I’ve been tasked with using Google Scholar to look up various research papers relating to the topic.
    * Later this day, Jake sent me an email providing me with links to different datasets, in addition to some resources explaining relation extra	ction.
