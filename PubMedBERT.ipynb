In extending these initial findings, we have shown that cardiac fibrosis (i) is not reversed by correction of mineralocorticoid-induced hypokalemia; (ii) appears not to involve the plasma or tissue renin-angiotensin systems, as fibrosis is largely unaffected by concurrent administration of Losartan or Perindopril; (iii) is independent of cardiac hypertrophy, in that it is equally seen in right and left ventricles, and in rats rendered hypertensive without cardiac hypertrophy by the administration of 9 alpha-fluorocortisol; (iv) is independent of elevated blood pressure, in that it is found in normotensive animals infused peripherally with aldosterone and intracerebroventricularly with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist RU28318; (v) is via classical MR, in that it is blocked by concurrent administration of the MR antagonist potassium canrenoate; and (vi) may or may not be a direct cardiac effect, inasmuch as data for in vivo effects on collagen formation by cardiac fibroblasts are conflicting. Although there is a high probability that the action of aldosterone to cause cardiac fibrosis in this experimental model is an effect via non-epithelial MR, the locus of aldosterone action remains to be established, as do the molecular mechanisms linking MR occupancy by aldosterone and collagen deposition. In addition, and in particular, the mechanisms underlying the crucial contribution of high salt intake in this model of mineralocorticoid excess await exploration.',\n",

In extending these initial findings, we have shown that cardiac fibrosis (i) is not reversed by correction of mineralocorticoid-induced hypokalemia; (ii) appears not to involve the plasma or tissue [E2] renin [/E2]-[E1] angiotensin [/E1][E2] angiotensin [/E2] systems, as fibrosis is largely unaffected by concurrent administration of [E1] Losartan [/E1] or [E1] Perindopril [/E1]; (iii) is independent of cardiac hypertrophy, in that it is equally seen in right and left ventricles, and in rats rendered hypertensive without cardiac hypertrophy by the administration of [E1] 9 alpha-fluorocortisol [/E1]; (iv) is independent of elevated blood pressure, in that it is found in normotensive animals infused peripherally with [E1] aldosterone [/E1] and intracerebroventricularly with the [E2] mineralocorticoid receptor [/E2] ([E2] MR [/E2]) antagonist [E1] RU28318 [/E1]; (v) is via classical [E2] MR [/E2], in that it is blocked by concurrent administration of the [E2] MR [/E2] antagonist [E1] potassium canrenoate [/E1]; and (vi) may or may not be a direct cardiac effect, inasmuch as data for in vivo effects on [E2] collagen [/E2] formation by cardiac fibroblasts are conflicting. Although there is a high probability that the action of [E1] aldosterone [/E1] to cause cardiac fibrosis in this experimental model is an effect via non-epithelial [E2] MR [/E2], the locus of [E1] aldosterone [/E1] action remains to be established, as do the molecular mechanisms linking [E2] MR [/E2] occupancy by [E1] aldosterone [/E1]'}]"

This binding was not significantly inhibited by the lysine analogue epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), indicating that plasminogen binding was not just through lysine binding sites as suggested for other plasminogen binding sites. We now report that once plasminogen is bound to gp330, it can be converted to its active form of plasmin by urokinase. This conversion of plasminogen to plasmin proceeds at a faster rate when plasminogen is first prebound to gp330. Although there is a proportional increase in the Vmax of the urokinase-catalyzed reaction with increasing gp330 concentrations, no change in Km was observed. Once activated, plasmin remains bound to gp330 in an active state capable of cleaving the chromogenic tripeptide, S-2251. The binding of plasmin to gp330 did not significantly change its enzymatic activity; however, gp330 did have a stabilizing effect on plasmin activity at 37 degrees C. While bound to gp330, plasmin is protected from inactivation by its natural inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin. The binding of plasmin to gp330 as analyzed by ELISA was shown to be time dependent, reversible, saturable, and specific for gp330. Inhibition of binding of both plasminogen and plasmin to gp330 by benzamidine was similar, although EACA inhibited the binding of plasmin to gp330 slightly more than the binding of plasminogen to gp330. These results indicate that the binding of plasminogen to gp330 serves as an effective means of increasing the rate of plasmin production on the glomerular and tubular epithelial cell surface while protecting the active plasmin from natural inhibitors.', 'entities': {'T1': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1455, 'end': 1466, 'text': 'benzamidine'}, 'T2': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1489, 'end': 1493, 'text': 'EACA'}, 'T3': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 292, 'end': 298, 'text': 'lysine'}, 'T4': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 308, 'end': 334, 'text': 'epsilon-amino caproic acid'}, 'T5': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 336, 'end': 340, 'text': 'EACA'}, 'T6': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 400, 'end': 406, 'text': 'lysine'}, 'T7': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1165, 'end': 1170, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T8': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1172, 'end': 1179, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T9': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 227, 'end': 238, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T10': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1236, 'end': 1255, 'text': 'alpha 2-antiplasmin'}, 'T11': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1272, 'end': 1279, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T12': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1288, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T13': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1382, 'end': 1387, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T14': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1419, 'end': 1430, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T15': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1435, 'end': 1442, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T16': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1446, 'end': 1451, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T17': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1519, 'end': 1526, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T18': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1530, 'end': 1535, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T19': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1570, 'end': 1581, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T20': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1585, 'end': 1590, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T21': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1635, 'end': 1646, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T22': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1650, 'end': 1655, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T23': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1711, 'end': 1718, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T24': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1812, 'end': 1819, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T25': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 359, 'end': 370, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T26': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 444, 'end': 455, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T27': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 495, 'end': 506, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T28': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 156, 'end': 185, 'text': 'Heymann nephritis autoantigen'}, 'T29': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 519, 'end': 524, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T30': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 568, 'end': 575, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T31': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 579, 'end': 588, 'text': 'urokinase'}, 'T32': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 609, 'end': 620, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T33': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 624, 'end': 631, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T34': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 663, 'end': 674, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T35': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 696, 'end': 701, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T36': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 764, 'end': 773, 'text': 'urokinase'}, 'T37': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 187, 'end': 192, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T38': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 809, 'end': 814, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T39': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 877, 'end': 884, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T40': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 902, 'end': 907, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T41': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 998, 'end': 1005, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T42': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1009, 'end': 1014, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T43': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1077, 'end': 1082, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T44': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1116, 'end': 1123, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T45': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 112, 'end': 117, 'text': 'gp330'}, 'T46': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 12, 'end': 19, 'text': 'plasmin'}, 'T47': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 32, 'end': 41, 'text': 'urokinase'}, 'T48': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 56, 'end': 67, 'text': 'plasminogen'}, 'T49': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 81, 'end': 110, 'text': 'Heymann nephritis autoantigen'}}, 'relations': [{'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T1', 'arg2': 'T14'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T1', 'arg2': 'T15'}, {'type': 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'arg1': 'T1', 'arg2': 'T16'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T17'}, {'type': 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T18'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T19'}, {'type': 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T20'}], 'labels': [], 'classes': [], 'entity_labels': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'tagged_text': 'Analysis of [E2] plasmin [/E2] binding and [E2] urokinase [/E2] activation of [E2] plasminogen [/E2] bound to the [E2] Heymann nephritis autoantigen [/E2], [E2] gp330 [/E2].\\nPreviously, we demonstrated that the [E2] Heymann nephritis autoantigen [/E2], [E2] gp330 [/E2], can serve as a receptor site for [E2] plasminogen [/E2].

The DA turnover was reduced remarkably by diphenhydramine, tripelennamine, and promethazine, and also significantly by chlorpheniramine, mepyramine, clemizole, and homochlorcyclizine, at doses used in the ordinary animal experiments. The 5-HT turnover was reduced markedly by mepyramine, tripelennamine, and chlorpheniramine. In contrast, the NA turnover was increased by promethazine and homochlorcyclizine, possibly due to their antagonistic effects on alpha-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that (1) the degree of inhibition of the uptake of DA and 5-HT by histamine H1-receptor antagonists is considerably different, (2) most H1-antagonists have little influence on NA uptake and some compounds enhance NA release, and that (3) carbinoxamine, clemastine, triprolidine, and meclizine have comparatively weak influences on monoamine metabolism. These effects on brain monoamine systems may be related to some central actions of histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as an addiction to these compounds combined with opioids.', 'entities':

The reaction, N-carbamyl-L-aspartate-->L-dihydroorotate (CA-asp-->DHO) catalyzed by malarial dihydroorotase is inhibited by L-6-thiodihydroorotate (TDHO) in vitro (Ki = 6.5 microM), and TDHO, as the free acid or methyl ester, induces a major accumulation of CA-asp in malaria. Atovaquone, a naphthoquinone, is a moderate inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in vitro (Ki = 27 microM) but induces major accumulations of CA-asp and DHO. Pyrazofurin induces accumulation of orotate and orotidine in malaria, consistent with inhibition of orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase with subsequent dephosphorylation of the OMP accumulated. Although TDHO, atovaquone, and pyrazofurin arrest the growth of P. falciparum, only moderate decreases in UTP, CTP, and dTTP were observed. 5-Fluoroorotate also arrests the growth of P. falciparum with major accumulations of 5-fluorouridine mono-, di-, and triphosphates and the most significant inhibition of de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides.\", 'entities': {'T1': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1100, 'end': 1114, 'text': 'dihydroorotate'}, 'T2': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1190, 'end': 1196, 'text': 'CA-asp'}, 'T3': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1204, 'text': 'DHO'}, 'T4': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1206, 'end': 1217, 'text': 'Pyrazofurin'}, 'T5': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1249, 'text': 'orotate'}, 'T6': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1254, 'end': 1263, 'text': 'orotidine'}, 'T7': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1306, 'end': 1332, 'text': \"orotidine 5'-monophosphate\"}, 'T8': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1334, 'end': 1337, 'text': 'OMP'}, 'T9': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1394, 'end': 1397, 'text': 'OMP'}, 'T10': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1420, 'end': 1424, 'text': 'TDHO'}, 'T11': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1436, 'text': 'atovaquone'}, 'T12': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1442, 'end': 1453, 'text': 'pyrazofurin'}, 'T13': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1551, 'end': 1566, 'text': '5-Fluoroorotate'}, 'T14': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1636, 'end': 1651, 'text': '5-fluorouridine'}, 'T15': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1652, 'end': 1681, 'text': 'mono-, di-, and triphosphates'}, 'T16': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1745, 'end': 1767, 'text': 'pyrimidine nucleotides'}, 'T17': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 411, 'end': 421, 'text': 'pyrimidine'}, 'T18': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 519, 'end': 535, 'text': '[14C]bicarbonate'}, 'T19': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 655, 'end': 671, 'text': '[14C]bicarbonate'}, 'T20': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 677, 'end': 699, 'text': 'pyrimidine nucleotides'}, 'T21': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 159, 'end': 181, 'text': 'pyrimidine nucleotides'}, 'T22': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 780, 'end': 802, 'text': 'N-carbamyl-L-aspartate'}, 'T23': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 805, 'end': 821, 'text': 'L-dihydroorotate'}, 'T24': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 823, 'end': 829, 'text': 'CA-asp'}, 'T25': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 832, 'end': 835, 'text': 'DHO'}, 'T26': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 890, 'end': 912, 'text': 'L-6-thiodihydroorotate'}, 'T27': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 914, 'end': 918, 'text': 'TDHO'}, 'T28': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 952, 'end': 956, 'text': 'TDHO'}, 'T29': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 965, 'end': 974, 'text': 'free acid'}, 'T30': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 978, 'end': 990, 'text': 'methyl ester'}, 'T31': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1030, 'text': 'CA-asp'}, 'T32': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1043, 'end': 1053, 'text': 'Atovaquone'}, 'T33': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1057, 'end': 1071, 'text': 'naphthoquinone'}, 'T34': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 43, 'end': 53, 'text': 'pyrimidine'}, 'T35': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1100, 'end': 1128, 'text': 'dihydroorotate dehydrogenase'}, 'T36': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1306, 'end': 1352, 'text': \"orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase\"}, 'T37': {'type': 'GENE-N', 'start': 850, 'end': 873, 'text': 'malarial dihydroorotase'}}, 'relations': [{'type': 'SUBSTRATE', 'arg1': 'T22', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'SUBSTRATE', 'arg1': 'T24', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'PRODUCT-OF', 'arg1': 'T23', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'PRODUCT-OF', 'arg1': 'T25', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T26', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T27', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T28', 'arg2': 'T37'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T33', 'arg2': 'T35'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T32', 'arg2': 'T35'}, {'type': 'SUBSTRATE', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T35'}, {'type': 'PRODUCT-OF', 'arg1': 'T3', 'arg2': 'T35'}, {'type': 'SUBSTRATE', 'arg1': 'T5', 'arg2': 'T36'}, {'type': 'SUBSTRATE', 'arg1': 'T6', 'arg2': 'T36'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T4', 'arg2': 'T36'}, {'type': 'SUBSTRATE', 'arg1': 'T9', 'arg2': 'T36'}], 'labels': [], 'classes': [], 'entity_labels': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], 'tagged_text': \"Cytotoxic effects of inhibitors of de novo [E1] pyrimidine [/E1] biosynthesis upon Plasmodium falciparum.\\nThe malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum can only synthesize [E1] pyrimidine nucleotides [/E1] via the de novo pathway which is therefore a suitable target for development of antimalarial drugs.

Eletriptan, like sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan and rizatriptan had highest affinity for the human 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and putative 5-ht1f receptor. Kinetic studies comparing the binding of [3H]eletriptan and [3H]sumatriptan to the human recombinant 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors expressed in HeLa cells revealed that both radioligands bound with high specificity (>90%) and reached equilibrium within 10-15 min. However, [3H]eletriptan had over 6-fold higher affinity than [3H]sumatriptan at the 5-HT1D receptor (K(D)): 0.92 and 6.58 nM, respectively) and over 3-fold higher affinity than [3H]sumatriptan at the 5-HT1B receptor (K(D): 3.14 and 11.07 nM, respectively). Association and dissociation rates for both radioligands could only be accurately determined at the 5-HT1D receptor and then only at 4 degrees C.

To investigate the possibility that felbamate's favorable toxicity profile could be related to NMDA receptor subtype selectivity, we examined the specificity of felbamate block of recombinant NMDA receptors composed of the NR1a subunit and various NR2 subunits.

The higher affinity of felbamate block of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit could be accounted for by more rapid association and slower dissociation from these sites.

This enzyme converts 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol to androsterone. The substrate has been implicated in supporting gestation and modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor activity. 17 beta HSDXI is colinear with human retinal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase retSDR2, a protein with no known biological activity (accession no. AAF06939). Of the proteins with known function, 17 beta HSDXI is most closely related to the retinol-metabolizing enzyme retSDR1, with which it has 30% identity. There is a polymorphic stretch of 15 adenosines in the 5' untranslated region of the cDNA sequence and a silent polymorphism at C719T. A 17 beta HSDXI construct with a stretch of 20 adenosines was found to produce significantly more enzyme activity than constructs containing 15 or less adenosines (43% vs. 26%, P < 0.005). The C719T polymorphism is present in 15% of genomic DNA samples. Northern blot analysis showed high levels of 17 beta HSDXI expression in the pancreas, kidney, liver, lung, adrenal, ovary, and heart. Immunohistochemical staining for 17 beta HSDXI is strong in steroidogenic cells such as syncytiotrophoblasts, sebaceous gland, Leydig cells, and granulosa cells of the dominant follicle and corpus luteum. In the adrenal 17 beta HSDXI, staining colocalized with the distribution of 17 alpha-hydroxylase but was stronger in the mid to outer cortex. 17 beta HSDXI was also found in the fetus and increased after birth. Liver parenchymal cells and epithelium of the endometrium and small intestine also stained. Regulation studies in mouse Y1 cells showed that cAMP down-regulates 17 beta HSDXI enzymatic activity (40% vs. 32%, P < 0.05) and reduces gene expression to undetectable levels.

This enzyme converts [E1] 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol [/E1] to [E1] androsterone [/E1]. The substrate has been implicated in supporting gestation and modulating [E1] gamma-aminobutyric acid [/E1] receptor activity. [E2] 17 beta HSDXI [/E2] is colinear with [E2] human retinal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase retSDR2 [/E2][E1] retinal [/E1] short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase retSDR2, a protein with no known biological activity (accession no.

In osteoarthritis (OA), the balance is disturbed by an increase in matrix degradative enzymes and a decrease in biosynthesis of constitutive extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagen type II and aggrecan. In this study, we examined the effects of the sulfate salt of glucosamine (GS) on the mRNA and protein levels of the proteoglycan aggrecan and on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 in cultured human OA articular chondrocytes. DESIGN: Freshly isolated chondrocytes were obtained from knee cartilage of patients with OA. Levels of aggrecan and MMP-3 were determined in culture media by employing Western blots after incubation with GS at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 200 microM. Zymography (casein) was performed to confirm that effects observed at the protein level were reflected at the level of enzymatic activity. Northern hybridizations were used to examine effects of GS on levels of aggrecan and MMP-3 mRNA. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assays were performed on the cell layers to determine levels of cell-associated GAG component of proteoglycans. RESULTS: Treatment of OA chondrocytes with GS (1.0-150 microM) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in aggrecan core protein levels, which reached 120% at 150 microM GS. These effects appeared to be due to increased expression of the corresponding gene as indicated by an increase in aggrecan mRNA levels in response to GS. MMP-3 levels decreased (18-65%) as determined by Western blots. Reduction of MMP-3 protein was accompanied by a parallel reduction in enzymatic activity. GS caused a dose-dependent increase (25-140%) in cell-associated GAG content. Chondrocytes obtained from 40% of OA patients failed to respond to GS. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that GS can stimulate mRNA and protein levels of aggrecan core protein and, at the same time, inhibit production and enzymatic activity of matrix-degrading MMP-3 in chondrocytes from OA articular cartilage.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. To evaluate the effect of carvedilol on both myocardial HIF-1alpha expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infra-renal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. Heart weight and the ratio of heart weight and body weight increased significantly after aortic banding for 4 weeks in the absence of drug treatment. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 +/- 9 mmHg in the sham group to 94 +/-5 mmHg (p < 0.001) in the banding group. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding. Mean arterial pressure decreased after treatment with carvedilol. The increased wall thickness and heart weight was reversed to normal by carvedilol. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were up-regulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) down-regulated in the banding group. Treatment with valsartan, doxazosin, or N-acetylcysteine did not significantly affect HIF-1alpha and VEGF proteins expression in the banding groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the banding group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the banding group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated, while NGF-beta mRNA and protein was downregulated in the rat model of pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy.

The purpose of this study was to assess screening methods for the detection of these enzymes in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: Isolates were selected according to a resistance phenotype consistent with production of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Detection of acquired ampC genes was done with a multiplex ampC-PCR and sequencing. The phenotypic detection methods evaluated included visual examination of antibiogram plates to identify the presence of scattered colonies located near the edge of the inhibition halo of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and a double-disc synergy test using cloxacillin (500 mg) to inhibit AmpC enzymes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven isolates were selected from among 6,209 isolates recovered. Acquired ampC genes (blaCMY-2, blaDHA-1, blaCMY-4 and blaACC-1) were found in 19 (24.7%) of these isolates, including 14 E. coli, two K. pneumoniae and three P. mirabilis isolates.

Similar results were obtained for the cloxacillin test, except for the E. coli isolates in which specificity was 10.3%.

METHODS: In an open-label, single-occasion design, 10 non-carriers, four heterozygous and six homozygous carriers of the variant OPRM1 118G allele received a computerized infusion of alfentanil to achieve target effect-site concentrations of 0, 33.33, 66.67 and 100 ng/ml. At each concentration level, analgesia was assessed by means of electrically and chemically induced pain, and respiratory depression was quantified by hypercapnic challenge and breathing frequency. RESULTS: The relationship between the percent change of tolerance to electrical stimuli and measured alfentanil concentrations, described by power models, was flatter in carriers of the 118G variant allele than in non-carriers, indicating decreased opioid analgesia (P<0.05). For chemically induced pain, a flatter analgesia versus concentration relationship was found only for homozygous carriers of the 118G allele (P<0.05). The relationship between the percent changes in respiratory parameters was significantly flatter (P<0.01) only in homozygous carriers as compared to heterozygous carriers and non-carriers of the 118G allele. Higher alfentanil concentrations were needed in homozygous carriers as compared to wild-type subjects (2-4 times) to produce the same degree of analgesia, whereas 10-12 times higher alfentanil concentrations were needed to produce the same degree of respiratory depression. CONCLUSION: OPRM1 118A>G polymorphism affects both analgesic and respiratory depressive effects of alfentanil.

However, although the activation of growth hormone-mediated signalling is well understood, the precise mechanism responsible for its regulation has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) modulates the action of growth hormone-mediated signalling by interacting with tyrosine kinase Jak2 (janus kinase 2) in a growth hormone-dependent manner. In the absence of PLCgamma1 (PLCgamma1(-/-)), growth hormone-induced JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation significantly increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, the re-expression of PLCgamma1 reduced growth hormone-induced Jak2 activation. Growth hormone-induced Jak2 phosphorylation was enhanced by siRNA-specific knockdown of PLCgamma1.

[E1] Homocysteine [/E1], the atherogenic product of the [E2] NNMT [/E2]-catalyzed reaction, was secreted from 3T3-L1 cells or adipose tissue cultures. [E1] Homocysteine [/E1] release increased during 3T3-L1 differentiation and was reduced when adipose tissue was treated with the [E2] NNMT [/E2] inhibitor [E1] 1-methylnicotinamide [/E1]. [E1] Nicotinic acid [/E1] ([E1] NA [/E1]), a widely used drug to lower elevated plasma lipid levels, induced [E2] NNMT [/E2] enzyme activity in white adipose tissue of mice. In tissue culture [E1] nicotinamide [/E1] treatment led to an increase in adipose tissue [E1] homocysteine [/E1] secretion.

It was reported previously that FVII gene (F7) expression was up-regulated by ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus-infected haemophilia patients; however, its precise mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of ribavirin-induced up-regulation of F7 expression in HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line). We found that intracellular GTP depletion by ribavirin as well as other IMPDH (inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, up-regulated F7 expression. FVII mRNA transcription was mainly enhanced by accelerated transcription elongation, which was mediated by the P-TEFb (positive-transcription elongation factor b) complex, rather than by promoter activation. Ribavirin unregulated ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia) 3 mRNA expression before F7 up-regulation. We observed that ribavirin enhanced ELL3 recruitment to F7, whereas knockdown of ELL3 diminished ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation. Ribavirin also enhanced recruitment of CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) and AFF4 to F7. These data suggest that ribavirin-induced intracellular GTP depletion recruits a super elongation complex containing P-TEFb, AFF4 and ELL3, to F7, and modulates FVII mRNA transcription elongation. Collectively, we have elucidated a basal mechanism for ribavirin-induced FVII mRNA up-regulation by acceleration of transcription elongation, which may be crucial in understanding its pleiotropic

Here we examined the expression of OXA immunoreactive (OXA-IR) cells in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the protein level of orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in the RVLM of SIHR, and we found that the expressions of OXA-IR and OX1R were higher than those of the control group. The double-staining immunohistochemical evidence showed that OX1R immunoreactive (OX1R-IR) cells and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunoreactive (IR) cells were co-localizated in the RVLM. Microinjection of OXA (10, 50, 100 pmol/100 nl) into the unilateral (right) RVLM of control rats or SIHR produced pressor and tachycardiac effects in a dose-dependent manner. SB-408124 (100 pmol/100 nl, an antagonist of OX1R) or TCS OX2 29 (100 pmol/100 nl, an antagonist of OX2R) partly abolished the cardiovascular effects of exogenously-administrated OXA into the RVLM of control rats and SIHR, and lowered the increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) of SIHR, with no difference in statistical significance between the two antagonists' effects. Microinjection into the RVLM of both control and SIHR groups of 7-Ni (0.05 pmol/100 nl, nNOS inhibitor) or Methylene Blue [100 pmol/100 nl, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)] suppressed the OXA-induced increase of SBP and HR, whereas microinjection of AG (1, 10, 100 pmol/100 nl) had no obvious effects on the OXA-induced increase of SBP and HR. Our results indicate that OXA in the RVLM may participate in the central regulation of cardiovascular activities in SIHR, and OX1R and OX2R both have important roles in it. The cardiovascular effects of OXA in the RVLM may be induced by nNOS-derived NO, which activated sGC-associated signaling pathway.\", 'entities': {'T1': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1330, 'end': 1339, 'text': 'SB-408124'}, 'T2': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1384, 'end': 1394, 'text': 'TCS OX2 29'}, 'T3': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1830, 'end': 1844, 'text': 'Methylene Blue'}, 'T4': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1896, 'text': 'guanylate'}, 'T5': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 263, 'end': 275, 'text': 'Nitric oxide'}, 'T6': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 285, 'end': 297, 'text': 'nitric oxide'}, 'T7': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 303, 'end': 305, 'text': 'NO'}, 'T8': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 2333, 'end': 2335, 'text': 'NO'}, 'T9': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 519, 'end': 521, 'text': 'NO'}, 'T10': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1025, 'end': 1037, 'text': 'nitric oxide'}, 'T11': {'type': 'CHEMICAL', 'start': 1067, 'end': 1079, 'text': 'nitric oxide'}, 'T12': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1090, 'end': 1094, 'text': 'iNOS'}, 'T13': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1176, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T14': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1375, 'end': 1379, 'text': 'OX1R'}, 'T15': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1388, 'end': 1391, 'text': 'OX2'}, 'T16': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1430, 'end': 1434, 'text': 'OX2R'}, 'T17': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1509, 'end': 1512, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T18': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 241, 'end': 248, 'text': 'orexins'}, 'T19': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1811, 'end': 1815, 'text': 'nNOS'}, 'T20': {'type': 'GENE-N', 'start': 1879, 'end': 1904, 'text': 'soluble guanylate cyclase'}, 'T21': {'type': 'GENE-N', 'start': 263, 'end': 284, 'text': 'Nitric oxide synthase'}, 'T22': {'type': 'GENE-N', 'start': 1906, 'end': 1909, 'text': 'sGC'}, 'T23': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1927, 'end': 1930, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T24': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 2047, 'end': 2050, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T25': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 2109, 'end': 2112, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T26': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 2209, 'end': 2213, 'text': 'OX1R'}, 'T27': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 2218, 'end': 2222, 'text': 'OX2R'}, 'T28': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 2286, 'end': 2289, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T29': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 2320, 'end': 2324, 'text': 'nNOS'}, 'T30': {'type': 'GENE-N', 'start': 2353, 'end': 2356, 'text': 'sGC'}, 'T31': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 421, 'end': 429, 'text': 'orexin-A'}, 'T32': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 431, 'end': 434, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T33': {'type': 'GENE-N', 'start': 515, 'end': 518, 'text': 'NOS'}, 'T34': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 679, 'end': 682, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T35': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 699, 'end': 702, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T36': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 771, 'end': 788, 'text': 'orexin 1 receptor'}, 'T37': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 790, 'end': 794, 'text': 'OX1R'}, 'T38': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 854, 'end': 857, 'text': 'OXA'}, 'T39': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 865, 'end': 869, 'text': 'OX1R'}, 'T40': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 976, 'end': 980, 'text': 'OX1R'}, 'T41': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 997, 'end': 1001, 'text': 'OX1R'}, 'T42': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1016, 'end': 1046, 'text': 'neuronal nitric oxide synthase'}, 'T43': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1048, 'end': 1052, 'text': 'nNOS'}, 'T44': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 1057, 'end': 1088, 'text': 'inducible nitric oxide synthase'}, 'T45': {'type': 'GENE-Y', 'start': 0, 'end': 8, 'text': 'Orexin A'}}, 'relations': [{'type': 'ANTAGONIST', 'arg1': 'T1', 'arg2': 'T14'}, {'type': 'ANTAGONIST', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T16'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T3', 'arg2': 'T20'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T3', 'arg2': 'T22'}, {'type': 'INHIBITOR', 'arg1': 'T3', 'arg2': 'T23'}, {'type': 'PRODUCT-OF', 'arg1': 'T8', 'arg2': 'T29'}, {'type': 'ACTIVATOR', 'arg1': 'T8', 'arg2': 'T30'}, {'type': 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'arg1': 'T1', 'arg2': 'T17'}, {'type': 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'arg1': 'T2', 'arg2': 'T17'}], 'labels': [], 'classes': [], 'entity_labels': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 'tagged_text': \"[E2] Orexin A [/E2] regulates cardiovascular responses in stress-induced hypertensive rats.\\nSeveral pieces of evidence indicate that the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is probably one of the key neural structures mediating the pressor effects of [E2] orexins [/E2] in the brain.

Microarray analysis revealed that mRNA levels of several cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-1beta, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 2, CCL20, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, and CXCL10 were significantly increased after cisplatin treatment in both isolated proximal tubules and whole kidney. Interestingly, tubular CCL2 mRNA levels increased soon after cisplatin administration, whereas CCL2 mRNA levels in whole kidney first decreased and then increased. Levels of both CCL2 and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in the whole kidney increased after cisplatin administration. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed CCL2 changes in the proximal tubular cells initially and then in the medullary interstitium. Urinary CCL2 excretion significantly increased approximately 3-fold compared with controls the day after cisplatin administration (5mg/kg), when no changes were observed plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Urinary levels of KIM-1 also increased 3-fold after cisplatin administration. In addition, urinary CCL2 rather than KIM-1 increased in chronic renal failure rats after administration of low-dose cisplatin (2mg/kg), suggesting that urinary CCL2 was selective for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in renal impairment. These results indicated that the increase in cytokine and chemokine expression in renal epithelial cells might be responsible for kidney deterioration in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, and that

We hypothesized that CREB is activated by a distinct signaling pathway in response to pulsatile GnRH in a frequency-dependent manner to dictate the FSHβ transcriptional response. GnRH stimulation of CREB phosphorylation (pCREB) in the gonadotrope-derived LβT2 cell line was attenuated by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89. A dominant negative PKA (DNPKA) reduced GnRH-stimulated pCREB and markedly decreased GnRH stimulation of FSHβ mRNA and FSHβLUC activity, but had little effect on LHβLUC activity, indicating relative specificity of this pathway. In perifusion studies, FSHβ mRNA levels and FSHβLUC activities were increased by pulsatile GnRH, with significantly greater increases at low compared with high pulse frequencies. DNPKA markedly reduced these GnRH-stimulated FSHβ responses at both low and high pulse frequencies. Correlating with FSHβ activation, both PKA activity and levels of pCREB were increased to a greater extent by low compared with high GnRH pulse frequencies, and the induction of pCREB was also attenuated by overexpression of DNPKA at both low and high pulse frequencies. Taken together, these data indicate that a PKA-mediated signaling pathway mediates GnRH activation of CREB at low-pulse frequencies, playing a significant role in the decoding of the hypothalamic GnRH

Currently, the most important insecticides are neonicotinoids, which are metabolized in vitro by AOX on reduction of the nitroimino group and by CYPs via oxidation reactions. The goal of this study was to establish the relative importance of AOX and CYPs in vivo using the mouse model. The procedure was to reduce liver AOX activity by providing tungsten or hydralazine in the drinking water or to use the AOX-deficient DBA/2 mouse strain. None of these approaches reduced CYP activity measured in vitro with an isozyme nonspecific substrate. Liver AOX activity was reduced by 45% with tungsten and 61% with hydralazine and 81% in AOX-deficient mice relative to controls. When mice were treated ip with the major neonicotinoid imidacloprid (IMI), metabolism by CYP oxidation reactions was not appreciably affected, whereas the AOX-generated nitrosoguanidine metabolite was decreased by 30% with tungsten and 56% with hydralazine and 86% in the AOX-deficient mice. The other IMI nitroreduction metabolite, desnitro-IMI, was decreased by 55%, 65%, and 81% with tungsten, hydralazine, and in the AOX-deficient mice, respectively.

            "{'pubmed_id': 23517912, 'text': 'Fisetin regulates obesity by targeting mTORC1 signaling.\\nFisetin, a flavonol present in vegetables and fruits, possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. To evaluate whether fisetin regulates mTORC1 signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and mTORC1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 and mTORC1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of S6K1, mTOR and Akt in fisetin-treated TSC2-knockdown cells. The results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mTORC1 activity in an Akt-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mTORC1 activity. Fisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mTOR. The inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mTOR activity, suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mTORC1 signaling. Fisetin supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue.

In this study, we for the first time generated mice carrying a conditional Runx2 allele with exon 4, which encodes the Runt domain, flanked by loxP sites. These mice were crossed with α1(I)-collagen-Cre or α1(II)-collagen-Cre transgenic mice to obtain osteoblast- or chondrocyte-specific Runx2 deficient mice, respectively. As seen in Runx2(-/-) mice, perinatal lethality was observed in α1(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, but this was not the case in animals in which α1(I)-collagen-Cre was used to delete Runx2. When using double staining with Alizarin red for mineralized matrix and Alcian blue for cartilaginous matrix, we observed previously that mineralization was totally absent at embryonic day 15.5 throughout the body in Runx2(-/-) mice, but was found in areas undergoing intramembranous ossification such as skull and clavicles in α1(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice. In newborn α1(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, mineralization impairment was restricted to skeletal areas undergoing endochondral ossification including long bones and vertebrae. In contrast, no apparent skeletal abnormalities were seen in mutant embryo, newborn, and 3- to 6-week old-mice in which Runx2 had been deleted with the α1(I)-collagen-Cre driver. These results suggest that Runx2 is absolutely required for endochondral ossification during embryonic and postnatal skeletogenesis, but that disrupting its expression in already committed osteoblasts as achieved here with the α1(I)-collagen-Cre driver does not affect overtly intramembranous and endochondral ossification.

Gypenosides is widely used as functional food and over-the-counter drug in East Asia. In this study, the in vitro inhibitory effects of gypenosides on the major human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) activities in human liver microsomes were examined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gypenosides showed the strongest inhibition of CYP2D6, followed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

Most of the reports discuss their role in intestinal inflammations. However, the role of adenosine A3 receptor agonist in pancreatitis has not been well established. The aim of this study is (Ed note: Purpose statements should be in present tense) to evaluate the effects of the adenosine A3 receptor agonist on the course of sodium taurocholate-induced experimental acute pancreatitis (EAP). The experiments were performed on 80 male Wistar rats, 58 of which survived, subdivided into 3 groups: C-control rats, I-EAP group, and II-EAP group treated with the adenosine A3 receptor agonist IB-MECA (1-deoxy-1-6[[(3-iodophenyl) methyl]amino]-9H-purin-9-yl)-N-methyl-B-D-ribofuronamide at a dose of 0.75\\xa0mg/kg b.w. i.p. at 48, 24, 12 and 1\\xa0h before and 1\\xa0h after the injection of 5\\xa0% sodium taurocholate solution into the biliary-pancreatic duct. Serum for α-amylase and lipase determinations and tissue samples for morphological examinations were collected at 2, 6, and 24\\xa0h of the experiment. In the IB-MECA group, α-amylase activity was decreased with statistically high significance compared to group I.

            "Previously, we demonstrated that the [E2] Heymann nephritis autoantigen [/E2], [E2] gp330 [/E2], can serve as a receptor site for [E2] plasminogen [/E2]. This binding was not significantly inhibited by the [E1] lysine [/E1] analogue [E1] epsilon-amino caproic acid [/E1] ([E1] EACA [/E1]), indicating that [E2] plasminogen [/E2] binding was not just through [E1] lysine [/E1] binding sites as suggested for other [E2] plasminogen [/E2] binding sites. We now report that once [E2] plasminogen [/E2] is bound to [E2] gp330 [/E2], it can be converted to its active form of [E2] plasmin [/E2] by [E2] urokinase [/E2]. This conversion of [E2] plasminogen [/E2] to [E2] plasmin [/E2] proceeds at a faster rate when [E2] plasminogen [/E2] is first prebound to [E2] gp330 [/E2]. Although there is a proportional increase in the Vmax of the [E2] urokinase [/E2]-catalyzed reaction with increasing [E2] gp330 [/E2] concentrations, no change in Km was observed. Once activated, [E2] plasmin [/E2] remains bound to [E2] gp330 [/E2] in an active state capable of cleaving the chromogenic tripeptide, S-2251. The binding of [E2] plasmin [/E2] to [E2] gp330 [/E2] did not significantly change its enzymatic activity; however, [E2] gp330 [/E2] did have a stabilizing effect on [E2] plasmin [/E2] activity at 37 degrees C. While bound to [E2] gp330 [/E2], [E2] plasmin [/E2] is protected from inactivation by its natural inhibitor [E2] alpha 2-antiplasmin [/E2]. The binding of [E2] plasmin [/E2] to [E2] gp330 [/E2] as analyzed by ELISA was shown to be time dependent, reversible, saturable, and specific for [E2] gp330 [/E2]. Inhibition of binding of both [E2] plasminogen [/E2] and [E2] plasmin [/E2] to [E2] gp330 [/E2] by [E1] benzamidine [/E1] was similar, although [E1] EACA [/E1] inhibited the binding of [E2] plasmin [/E2] to [E2] gp330 [/E2] slightly more than the binding of [E2] plasminogen [/E2] to [E2] gp330 [/E2]. These results indicate that the binding of [E2] plasminogen [/E2] to [E2] gp330 [/E2] serves as an effective means of increasing the rate of [E2] plasmin [/E2] production on the glomerular and tubular epithelial cell surface while protecting the active [E2] plasmin [/E2]\n"

predictor of future CVD or DM, because oxidative stress contributes to their pathogenesis.', 'A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 713 Japanese participants (458 males and 255 females) during a health screening program.', 'The prevalence of NAFLD was 18.7%.', 'Water extract of licorice had anti-viral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus in human respiratory tract cell lines.', 'ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Leguminosae) has been used in herbal medicine and food supplement worldwide for centuries.', 'Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV).', 'There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata.', 'However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent.', 'AIM OF THE STUDY: We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines.', 'We also tried to find out the active constituent.', 'RESULTS: Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001).', 'The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells.', 'However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells.', 'Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells.', 'The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR.', '300μg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension.', 'CONCLUSIONS: Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and

not been examined.', 'An emerging treatment strategy therefore aims at enhancing GABAergic signalling by increasing the excitatory transmission onto interneurons.', 'Enhanced excitability in the infralimbic cortex produces anxiety-like behaviors.', 'The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in modulating anxiety.', 'However, it is unknown whether excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission in the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the mPFC underlies the pathology of anxiety-related behavior.', 'IL cortex activation decreased the time spent in the center area in the open field test, decreased exploration of the open-arms in the elevated plus maze test, and increased the latency to bite food in the novelty-suppressed feeding test.', 'The increase in RGC survival at 2 weeks was accompanied by a reduction in phagocytic microglia.', 'Since HMI-1b11 did not impair cell survival even at the highest concentration tested (20μM), and supported neurite growth and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, we focused on studying its downstream signaling cascades and effects on gene expression.', 'Consistently, genome-wide gene expression microarray and gene set
