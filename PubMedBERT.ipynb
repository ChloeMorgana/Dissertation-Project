              "  'text': 'Candoxatril, an orally active neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, raises plasma atrial natriuretic factor and is natriuretic in essential hypertension.\\nOBJECTIVE: Candoxatril (UK79,300) is an orally available inhibitor of the neutral endopeptidase (E.C.3.4.24.11) which degrades atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). This study was designed to establish initial safety and efficacy data in essential hypertension for this novel class of drug. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose comparison of candoxatril with placebo in a crossover manner. Three doses of candoxatril (10, 50 and 200 mg) were used, with four subjects at each dose level. SETTING: The Medical Research Council Blood Pressure Unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, UK (a hospital clinical research unit). PATIENTS: Twelve patients with untreated essential hypertension. Diastolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mmHg on three separate occasions before entry to the study. INTERVENTION: Candoxatril or matching placebo was administered orally in the fasting state. Serial measurements of urinary volume and electrolyte excretion were taken (on each hour, urine volume was replaced with an equivalent volume of water by mouth). Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded for 12 h after drug administration and serial blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma ANF and neurohormone concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine volume and electrolyte concentration; blood pressure; heart rate; plasma atrial natriuretic factor. RESULTS: Plasma ANF concentrations rose significantly in all patients within 2 h of candoxatril administration compared with placebo although peak and integrated ANF levels were similar at all three doses. A significant natriuresis was only seen after 200 mg candoxatril, with a greater cumulative urine sodium excretion over 12 h compared with placebo; this was associated with a greater diuresis over 12 h compared with placebo. After a single oral dose of candoxatril, blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Candoxatril in a single dose caused no adverse effects in essential hypertension. The drug caused a rise in basal ANF levels at all doses, but natriuresis was only seen with the highest dose used. No change in blood pressure was recorded after acute dosing, and the results of chronic studies with this compound are awaited. Oral inhibitors of ANF degradation may have therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disorders.',\n",

This study was designed to establish initial safety and efficacy data in essential hypertension for this novel class of drug. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose comparison of [E1] candoxatril [/E1] with placebo in a crossover manner. Three doses of [E1] candoxatril [/E1] (10, 50 and 200 mg) were used, with four subjects at each dose level. SETTING: The Medical Research Council Blood Pressure Unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, UK (a hospital clinical research unit). PATIENTS: Twelve patients with untreated essential hypertension. Diastolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mmHg on three separate occasions before entry to the study. INTERVENTION: [E1] Candoxatril [/E1] or matching placebo was administered orally in the fasting state. Serial measurements of urinary volume and electrolyte excretion were taken (on each hour, urine volume was replaced with an equivalent volume of water by mouth). Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded for 12 h after drug administration and serial blood samples were taken for measurement of [E2] plasma ANF [/E2] and neurohormone concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine volume and electrolyte concentration; blood pressure; heart rate; [E2] plasma atrial natriuretic factor [/E2]. RESULTS: [E2] Plasma ANF [/E2] concentrations rose significantly in all patients within 2 h of [E1] candoxatril [/E1] administration compared with placebo although peak and integrated [E2] ANF [/E2] levels were similar at all three doses. A significant natriuresis was only seen after 200 mg [E1] candoxatril [/E1], with a greater cumulative urine [E1] sodium [/E1] excretion over 12 h compared with placebo; this was associated with a greater diuresis over 12 h compared with placebo. After a single oral dose of [E1] candoxatril [/E1], blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: [E1] Candoxatril [/E1] in a single dose caused no adverse effects in essential hypertension. The drug caused a rise in basal [E2] ANF [/E2] levels at all doses, but natriuresis was only seen with the highest dose used. No change in blood pressure was recorded after acute dosing, and the results of chronic studies with this compound are awaited. Oral inhibitors of [E2] ANF [/E2]'}]"

Unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, UK (a hospital clinical research unit).', 'PATIENTS: Twelve patients with untreated essential hypertension.', 'Diastolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mmHg on three separate occasions before entry to the study.', 'Serial measurements of urinary volume and electrolyte excretion were taken (on each hour, urine volume was replaced with an equivalent volume of water by mouth).', 'No change in blood pressure was recorded after acute dosing, and the results of chronic studies with this compound are awaited.', 'The antinociception induced by i.c.v.', 'This inhibition was only maintained for 16 hours, after which both the amplitude and frequency of electromyographic bursts and contractions returned.', 'Although peak H is made in relatively large amounts in vivo, it has not yet been possible to synthesize it in vitro.', 'Metabolic products were isolated by lipid extraction, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by direct-probe mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.', 'Each of these three major types can be divided into three subtypes.', 'Both of these receptor subtypes as well as a third, the alpha 1C, have been identified by molecular cloning.', 'Prototypic tissues and cell lines in continuous culture have been developed for each of these subtypes, which facilitated their study.', 'The definition of the alpha 2 subtypes has been based on radioligand binding data and more limited functional data.', 'Ocular beta-blockers in glaucoma management.', 'Clinical pharmacological aspects.', 'Topical beta-blockers reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by blockade of sympathetic nerve endings in the ciliary epithelium causing a fall in aqueous humour production.', 'The most serious side effects of beta-blockers are the exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease with nonselective agents and the precipitation of bronchospasm in some patients.', 'Different neuroleptics show common dose and time dependent effects in quantitative field potential analysis in freely moving rats.', 'Under the assumption that field potentials recorded from particular brain areas reflect the net balance of neurotransmitter activities, the dose- and time-dependent responses induced by intraperitoneal application of different neuroleptic drugs are quantified by spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram recorded from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation.', 'This observed pattern of changes is in line with the neuroleptic induced spectral changes reported in the literature for other animals and man.', 'In the light of the already known effects of other psychoactive drugs on the frequency content of field potentials in the rat, it should now be possible to classify different drugs in terms of their clinical indication.', 'Body weight was reduced, most likely reflecting chronic natriuretic or diuretic effects, or both, and there was a trend toward increased cardiac index and reduced preload values.', 'Previously we showed that a rapid injection of PAF into the pulmonary artery of an isolated rat lung produced an extended

based on the American Fertility Society classification scheme, with stage I being the mildest and stage IV the most severe form of the disease.', \"The management of endometriosis depends on the extent of the disease, the severity of the symptoms, the age of the patient, and the patient's desire for future fertility.\", 'Treatment modalities include expectant management, surgery, induction of

flashes.', 'Mechanisms of lipid-lowering agents.', 'Lipid-lowering agents are used with the purpose of ameliorating hyperlipoproteinemias, in order to prevent arterial disease.', 'Lipid-lowering drugs can be classified into absorbable agents and into nonabsorbable compounds, acting within the gastrointestinal lumen.', 'The morphology of the microtubules was, however, affected.', 'These differences in the affinities may be responsible for their different psychopharmacological effects in the clinical treatment of patients.', 'Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160).', 'After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued.', 'During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased.', 'Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 +/- 18 to 39 +/- 14 s and on

(charge transfer interaction), as seen by resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy.', 'No binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was observed.', 'The same drugs were also tested ex vivo.', 'The compound also exhibited moderate antitumor activity against murine leukemia P388 (T/C value of 169% at a daily dose of 400 mg/kg) and against M5076 sarcoma (T/C value of 135% at a daily dose of 600 mg/kg).', 'The drug was inactive against B16 melanoma, Lewis lung, colon 38 and CD8F1 mammary carcinomas.', 'The compound exhibited significant cytotoxicity against hepatoma 3924A cells in culture (LC50 = 6 microM).', 'The protection studies and competitive kinetics of inhibition demonstrate that the affinity alkylator is active site-directed.', 'Permanent cell culture lines derived from human breast cancer tissue are important experimental models in the study of human breast cancer cell proliferation.', 'No subunit exchange between adjacent dimers within the heterooctamer could be observed even after storage for 3 months at 4 degrees C.', 'In control medium neurons responded to depolarizing current pulses with SRF.', 'Partial agonist and inverse agonist beta CCs did not limit SRF at concentrations up to 200 nM.', 'Mean arterial pressure (MAP) began to fall 2-3 h after dosing in parallel with a decrease in SVR.', 'At the end of the acute study, MAP and SVR were decreased by 18.1 +/- 2.7% and 15.6 +/- 5.6%, respectively.', 'Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate did not change.', 'The 45-mg K3/kg/day supplement was not palatable and had to be discontinued.', 'Lymphocyte cultures from patients affected by retinoblastoma (Rb), with or without a microdeletion of chromosome 13, and Wilms tumor (WT), with a microdeletion of chromosome 11p where exposed to

patients and controls, nor between patients carrying or not a microdeletion.', 'A warning.', 'Nonlinear regression analysis of the performed saturation experiments revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 7.7 +/- 0.4 nM and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 70.4 +/- 9.5 pmol/mg protein.', 'Specific binding could be inhibited completely by several histaminergic ligands.', 'All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration.', 'The specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by receptor competition and immunoprecipitation studies.', 'The observed fluorescence in the neuroblastoma cells was prevented by pre-adsorption of the antibody with purified receptor from rat brain.', 'No change in the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization occurred except at the highest concentration (18 mumol l(-1).', \"The k1's for association in right and left atria were 6.5 X 10(9) l/mol-min and 2.3 X 10(9) l/mol-min respectively, while the k-1's for dissociation were 0.20 min-1 and 0.17 min-1.\", 'There the complexes associate with specific DNA sequences and modulate the rate of transcription of DNA into specific RNAs that code for the synthesis of proteins that elicit biological responses.', 'Drug concentrations measured in the cerebral cortex 1 h after administration were directly proportional to dose for all three compounds.', 'Binding returned to control values at doses of greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg.', 'Similar results were obtained in time course studies.', 'At 8 and 10 h after a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p., corresponding to cortex concentrations of 2.7-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased compared with controls.', 'Similarly, at 1, 2, and 3 h after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg, corresponding to cortex concentrations of 3.7-5.8 ng/g, receptor binding was also increased.', 'Comparison of ophthalmic beta-blocking agents.', 'With AS 1001 SLI levels were reduced in all tissues.', 'Gel permeation chromatography of stomach extracts measured with AS 1001 showed a reduction in both SS-14 and SS-28.', 'With duodenal extracts the elution profiles with AS 1001 reflected the large reduction in total SLI whereas with AS 26.3.2 a smaller reduction occurred.', 'New peptide peaks which developed were not all detectable by radioimmunoassay with either antibody.', 'This effect was observed as early as Day 7 and was accompanied by one confirmed hemorrhagic death.', 'Animals fed the purified diet lost weight faster and diet sooner than those maintained on the other diets.', 'Bone fractures were not observed in these animals because of early deaths resulting from hemorrhaging.', 'The largest fragment, containing residues 1-90, retained only 5% of the drug binding activity of the intact protein.', \"The complete DNA sequence of about 38 kilobases for the gene and the adjacent 5' and 3' flanking regions was established by the dideoxy chain termination and chemical degradation methods.\", \"The gene contained about 33.5 kilobases of DNA, including seven introns and eight exons within the coding and 3' noncoding regions of the gene.\", \"A fifth Alu repetitive sequence was found immediately flanking the 3' end of the gene.\", 'A 50 base pair insert in intron A was found in a clone from one of the genomic libraries but was absent in clones from the other library.', \"The 5' flanking region also contained a 1.9-kb HindIII subfamily repeat.\", 'The high-affinity sites are preserved during affinity chromatography and the process results in a 6080-fold purification of those sites.',

similar to those associated with villous atrophy in coeliac disease.', 'The identity of the product was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as well as ultraviolet and infrared spectral studies.', 'Lysis of cells in dilute alkali and subsequent electrophoretic analysis of the isolated DNA show that the DNA of treated cells includes a high molecular weight component and a population of 2-10-kilobase single-stranded DNA fragments while untreated cells contain only high molecular weight DNA.', 'The ability of these substances to stimulate DNA synthesis in short-term
