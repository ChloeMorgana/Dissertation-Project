# Work Done
* Ran the corpus with different values to obtain more results
* Wrote more of my dissertation

# Findings
* I decided to abandon the fine-tuning process since it is too time-consuming to implement given the short time period until submission.
* I have now gathered the vast majority of my results, other than performing dropout on the masked entity architectures.
* I am now approximately halfway through my dissertation.

# Questions
* When would be the best time to be able to get you to proofread my dissertation before the deadline?
* I'm testing several fixed-length representations with different dropout levels etc. and it's resulting in me having not very pleasing tables. Are there any aesthetically pleasing data visualisation methods you can recommend?
* How in-depth should I go with the methods/analysis? I'm finding myself explicitly describing the structure of the dataset.
