# Work Done
* Ran all of the data I need to evaluate
* Finished the first draft of the dissertation

# Findings
* I didn't manage to completely polish off my first draft given the timeframe, so there are a couple of bits and bobs that require refining later on.
* I wasn't quite sure about how I was structuring the research questions vs methods part, as I felt like I needed to elaborate on my methodology in order to justify the question proposal but also not reveal too much about implementation.
* The page count isn't quite what it needs to be. I'm planning on writing a dicussion chapter explaining other results I obtained, however if there are any additional things I could add, please let me know.
* Presumaby, more analysis can be made for these research questions, particularly critiquing the methodology used etc.


# Questions
* I'm very conscious of time and I feel like I won't have enough to be able to make and do the presentation for Wednesday, in addition to all my other work. What do you suggest?
* Would you like my draft as a PDF or a link to overleaf?
