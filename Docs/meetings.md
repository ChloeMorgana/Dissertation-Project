# Meeting Log

## Week 2
* 03/10/22 [20 mins]
    * This was the introductory meeting in which Jake elaborated on the logistics of the project. We discussed the dataset that I’ll be using to perform extraction methods on and he agreed to send me several sources relating to different topics in the biomedical field to choose from. I’ve been tasked with using Google Scholar to look up various research papers relating to the topic.
    * Later this day, Jake sent me an email providing me with links to different datasets, in addition to some resources explaining relation extraction.

## Week 3
* 11/10/22 [20 mins]
    * We had a discussion about the type of dataset that I had chosen, namely the CDR corpus, and Jake informed me that using the DrugProt corpus may be more appropriate, since it indicates specific mentions of chemicals and diseases to focus on.
    * We discussed that using deep learning methodologies may be the most appropriate for this relation extraction task, and established that my goal for this week was to investigate BERT.
    * Jake also warned me about certain technologies that I had investigated, particularly DNorm, stating that sometimes it might be necessary to add some conditional statements to make it function appropriately.
    * I also need to investigate different error analysis techniques in order to observe different errors in the model I create.
    * Jake suggested I gain an account to use a GPU machine in order to process large amounts of data and not overwhelm my laptop, and also suggested that I use either Google Colab or Kaggle to write my code with.
    * Later that day, I was sent some links to Google Colab notebooks that he created explaining how to load the data for each dataset, in addition to a blog about working with contextual vectors with HuggingFace.
