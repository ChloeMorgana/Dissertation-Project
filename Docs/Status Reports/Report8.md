## Work Done
* Added my own tokens to the tokenizer
* Changed entity function so it only does [E1] and [E2] because my previous method was too complex
* Found a way to determine whether a sentence contains a relation or not

## Findings
* Had a problem with finding the labels for the specific sentence (contains a relation or not).

## Questions
* When do you want the status report?
* When I try to run pytorch with my additional tokenizers, it says that the index is out of range. What do?
