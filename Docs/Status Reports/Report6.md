## Work Done 
* This week I focused on implementing the entity markers entity start architecture from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03158.pdf)

## Findings

## Questions
* I looked at the number of sentences containing both [E1] and [E2] tags and saw that the number was only around 400, when apparently there are meant to be around 24000 relationships. What did I do wrong?
