# Work Done
* Changed BERT dropout parameters and experienced a negligible change so far
* Added more to my dissertation

# Findings
* I'm tempted to try and see if I can implement either a linear layer or a softmax layer
* I'm making good progress with my dissertation
* I think it would be interesting to compare feature extraction with fine-tuning

# Questions
* How should I adapt my research questions to accomodate fine-tuning?
