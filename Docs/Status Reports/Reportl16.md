# Work Done
* Ran the corpus with different values to obtain more results
* Wrote more of my dissertation

# Findings
* I decided to abandon the fine-tuning process since it is too time-consuming to implement given the short time period until submission
* I have now gathered results for dropout values of 0.7, in addition to performing entity masking with special mask tags.
