# Work Done
* Started re-structuring my dissertation
* Started introducing the development set into the mix just to complicate things more
* Found [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76508-8_11#chapter-info) that tested different dropout hyperparameters on BERT

# Findings
* Initial difference of 32 between embeddings and labels
* I read up more about dropout with BERT and it would seem that dropout applies to all layers of BERT, with default probability of 0.1
