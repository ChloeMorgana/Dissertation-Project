## Work Done
* Had a peruse of the dissertation template and attempted to fill in as much as I can
* Found a solution to finding the labels of the entity tags


## Findings
* I'm currently sort of extracting the CLS and entity tag embeddings all at once and the code is sort of all jumbled and on top of each other. I'm tempted to separate them in some way (or at the very least indicate when I'm doing CLS stuff and when I'm doing entity tag stuff).
* I'm waiting for the university computers to work again because I stupidly started working on my progress report on there and didn't back it up, and I refuse to restart until I know for sure I have to.
* The number of embeddings and relations found doesn't make sense. There are around 17000 relations listed in the corpus, so I thought that the labels found for all of these would be over this amount, but it is significantly less ...
