## Work Done
* Had a peruse of the dissertation template and attempted to fill in as much as I can
* Found a solution to finding the labels of the entity tags
* Got the pipeline working for the entity tagging architecture
* Ran the code across the entire corpus for the first time


## Findings
* I'm currently sort of extracting the CLS and entity tag embeddings all at once and the code is sort of all jumbled and on top of each other. I'm tempted to separate them in some way (or at the very least indicate when I'm doing CLS stuff and when I'm doing entity tag stuff).
* I'm waiting for the university computers to work again because I stupidly started working on my progress report on there and didn't back it up, and I refuse to restart until I know for sure I have to.
* I ran it across the whole corpus and after an hour it moaned that one of the entries had embeddings that exceeded 512 tokens (had 606).
