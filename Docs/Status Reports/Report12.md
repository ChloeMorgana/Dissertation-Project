# Work Done
* Made some progress with the background section of my dissertation
* Got a slightly more functional pipeline for both cls and entity-start embeddings

# Findings
* In one of the papers, it mentioned the idea of an 'activation function' so I was curious as to how that affected the quality of the model.

# Questions
* Do you have any advice on how to elaborate on the research questions? e.g. Adding conditions etc.
* How detailed do the slides have to be for when I do a presentation?
